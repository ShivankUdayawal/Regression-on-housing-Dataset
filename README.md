Performing Regression on Housing Dataset and Predicting the house Price.

* In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the ‘outcome variable’) and one or more independent variables (often called ‘predictors’, ‘covariates’, or ‘features’).
 
 The terminology you will often listen related to regression analysis is:

### Dependent variable or target variable :  Variable to predict.

### Independent variable or predictor variable :  Variables to estimate the dependent variable.

### Outlier :  Observation that differs significantly from other observations. It should be avoided since it may hamper the result. 



## Introduction

* This notebook is going to be focused on solving the problem of predicting house prices for house buyers and house sellers.

* A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

* We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.

* We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.
