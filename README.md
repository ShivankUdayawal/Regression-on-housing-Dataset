## Performing Regression on Housing Dataset and Predicting the house Price.

* In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the ‘outcome variable’) and one or more independent variables (often called ‘predictors’, ‘covariates’, or ‘features’).
 
### The terminology you will often listen related to regression analysis is :

* Dependent variable or target variable :  Variable to predict.

* Independent variable or predictor variable :  Variables to estimate the dependent variable.

* Outlier :  Observation that differs significantly from other observations. It should be avoided since it may hamper the result. 

* Multicollinearity :  Situation in which two or more independent variables are highly linearly related.

* Homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variance :  Situation in which the error term is the same across all values of the independent variables.


Regression analysis is primarily used for two distinct purposes. First, it is widely used for prediction and forecasting, which overlaps with the field of machine learning. Second, it is also used to infer causal relationships between independent and dependent variables.


## Introduction

* This notebook is going to be focused on solving the problem of predicting house prices for house buyers and house sellers.

* A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

* We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.

* We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.
